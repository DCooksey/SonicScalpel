Sonic Scalpel is a open source, Audio Denoising program.

The denoising is accomplished using Source Separation via Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF.)

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

For the NMF part of the program to work please enter the mlpack directory, view its README and install the libraries to your computer. This should work fine on Mac and Linux.
                   
This program uses the Maximilian DSP library for holding the recordings in memory and for the Spectral Analysis. This is included in the repository and should work with the command below.

I get Sonic Scalpel running on linux with Jack Audio by the following command:
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -D__UNIX_JACK__ -o maximilian main.cpp RtAudio.cpp player.cpp maximilian.cpp maxiFFT.cpp fft.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs jack` -lpthread -I/usr/include -L /usr/lib -lportsf -lsndfile
